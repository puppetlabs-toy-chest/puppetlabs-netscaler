##Overview

The netscaler module enables Puppet configuration of Citrix NetScaler devices through types and REST-based providers.

##Module Description

This module uses REST to manage various aspects of NetScaler load balancers, and acts
as a foundation for building higher level abstractions within Puppet.

The module allows you to manage NetScaler nodes and pool configuration through Puppet.

##Setup

###Beginning with netscaler

Before you can use the netscaler module, you must create a proxy system able to run `puppet device`.  In order to do so, you will have a Puppet master and a Puppet agent as usual, and the agent will be the "proxy system" for `puppet device`.

(The `puppet device` subcommand interacts with administrative interfaces, allowing resources to talk to the device and translating the module into network calls.

**TODO^^^ Run that by Hunter.**

This means you must create a device.conf file in the Puppet conf directory (either /etc/puppet or /etc/puppetlabs/puppet) on the Puppet agent. Within your device.conf, you must have:


~~~
[<DEVICE CERTNAME>]
  type netscaler
  url https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<IP ADDRESS or FULLY QUALIFIED HOST NAME>/nitro/v1/
~~~

In the above example, the username and password must be for a user with superuser privileges (i.e., the NetScaler administrator). The default admin username is 'nsroot'. The certname should be the certname of the NetScaler device.

Additionally, you must install the faraday gem on the proxy host (Puppet agent). You can do this by declaring the `faraday` class on that host. If you do not install the faraday gem, the module will not work.

##Usage

###Set up two load-balanced web servers

####Before you begin

This example is built around the following infrastructure: A server running a Puppet master is connected to the NetScaler device. The NetScaler device contains a management VLAN, a client VLAN that contains the virtual server, and a server VLAN that connects to the two web servers the module will be setting up. 

In order to successfully set up your web servers, you must know the following information about your systems:

* The IP addresses of both of the web servers.
* The names of the nodes each web server will be on.
* The ports the web servers are listening on.
* The IP address of the virtual server.

####Step One: Classifying your device

In your site.pp file, enter the below code:

**TODO:Check/Update**

~~~
node 'device certname' {
  netscaler_server { '1_10_server1':
  ensure  => present,
  address => '1.10.1.1',
  }
netscaler_service { '1_10_service1':
  ensure      => 'present',
  server_name => '1_10_server1',
  port        => '80',
  protocol    => 'HTTP',
  comments    => 'This is a comment'
}
netscaler_lbvserver { '1_10_lbvserver1':
  ensure       => 'present',
  service_type => 'HTTP',
  ip_address   => '1.10.1.2',
  port         => '8080',
  state        => true,
}
netscaler_lbvserver_service_binding { '1_10_lbvserver1/1_10_service1':
  ensure => 'present',
  weight => '100',
}
netscaler_rewritepolicy { '2_4_rewritepolicy_test1':
  ensure                  => 'present',
  action                  => 'NOREWRITE',
  comments                => 'comment',
  expression              => 'HTTP.REQ.URL.SUFFIX.EQ("")',
  undefined_result_action => 'DROP',
}
netscaler_csvserver { '2_4_csvserver_test1':
  ensure        => 'present',
  service_type  => 'HTTP',
  state         => true,
  ip_address    => '2.4.1.1',
  port          => '8080',
}
netscaler_csvserver_rewritepolicy_binding { '2_4_csvserver_test1/2_4_rewritepolicy_test1':
  ensure               => present,
  priority             => 1,
  invoke_vserver_label => '2_4_csvserver_test1',
  choose_type          => 'Request',
}
}
~~~

####Step Two: Run `puppet device`

Run the following to have the proxy node apply your classifications and configure the NetScaler device: 

~~~
$ https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<IP ADDRESS or FULLY QUALIFIED HOST NAME>> puppet device -v --user=root
~~~

If you do not run this command, clients will not be able to make requests to the web servers.

At this point, your NetScaler should be ready to handle requests for the web servers.

###Tips and tricks

####Basic usage

Once you've established a basic configuration, you can explore the providers and their allowed options by running `puppet resource <TYPENAME>` for each type. This will provide a starting point for seeing what's already on your NetScaler. If anything failed to set up properly, it will not show up when you run the command.

Call the types from the proxy system.

$ FACTER_url=https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<NETSCALER1.EXAMPLE.COM> puppet resource netscaler_lbvserver
~~~

####Roles and profiles

The [above example](#set-up-two-load-balanced-web-servers) is a proof-of-concept for setting up a simple configuration of two web servers. We recommend using the roles and profiles pattern for anything else.

#####`icmp_virtual_server_response`

How the NetScaler appliance responds to ping requests received for an IP address that is common to one or more virtual servers. Available settings function as follows:

* If set to PASSIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance always responds to the ping requests.
* If set to ACTIVE on all the virtual servers that share the IP address, the appliance responds to the ping requests if at least one of the virtual servers is UP. Otherwise, the appliance does not respond.
* If set to ACTIVE on some virtual servers and PASSIVE on the others, the appliance responds if at least one virtual server with the ACTIVE setting is UP. Otherwise, the appliance does not respond.
  
Note: This parameter is available at the virtual server level. A similar parameter, ICMP Response, is available at the IP address level, for IPv4 addresses of type VIP. To set that parameter, use the add ip command in the CLI or the Create IP dialog box in the GUI.

#####`ip_address`

Specifies the set of IP addresses expected in the monitoring response from the DNS server if the record type is A or AAAA. Applicable to DNS monitors.

Valid options: An IP address or an array of IP addresses.

#####`ip_mask`

IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, 255.255.240.0 or 0.0.255.255). Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits of the destination IP address in a client request are to be matched with the corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask. The latter is called a reverse mask.

#####`ip_pattern`

IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern.  Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter.

For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0 and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254.  You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).

If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if virtual servers vs1 and vs2 have the same IP pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1. If a destination IP address matches two or more virtual servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server 

#####`layer2_parameters`

#####`precedence`

The precedence on the content switching virtual server between rule-based and URL-based policies. 

Valid options: RULE, URL. The default precedence is RULE.

* RULE: If the precedence is configured as RULE, the incoming request is applied against the content switching policies created with the -rule argument. If none of the rules match, then the URL in the request is applied against the content switching policies created with the -url option.

  For example, this precedence can be used if certain client attributes (such as a specific type of browser) need to be served different content and all other clients can be served from the content distributed among the servers.

* URL: If the precedence is configured as URL, the incoming request URL is applied against the content switching policies created with the -url option. If none of the policies match, then the request is applied against the content switching policies created with the -rule option.

  This precedence can also be used if some content (such as images) is the same for all clients, but other content (such as text) is different for different clients. In this case, the images will be served to all clients, but the text will be served to specific clients based on specific attributes, such as Accept-Language.

Name of the type PUSH/SSL_PUSH lbvserver to which the server pushes updates received on the client-facing load balancing virtual server.

#####`range`

Number of IP addresses that the appliance must generate and assign to the virtual server. The virtual server then functions as a network virtual server, accepting traffic on any of the generated IP addresses. The IP addresses are generated automatically, as follows:

* For a range of n, the last octet of the address specified by the IP Address parameter increments n-1 times.
* If the last octet exceeds 255, it rolls over to 0 and the third octet increments by 1.

* 'BANDWIDTH' - Spillover occurs when the bandwidth consumed by the virtual server's incoming and outgoing traffic exceeds the threshold.
* 'HEALTH' - Spillover occurs when the percentage of weights of the services that are UP drops below the threshold. For example, if services svc1, svc2, and svc3 are bound to a virtual server, with weights 1, 2, and 3, and the spillover threshold is 50%, spillover occurs if svc1 and svc3 or svc2 and svc3 transition to DOWN.

IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, 255.255.240.0 or 0.0.255.255). Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits of the destination IP address in a client request are to be matched with the corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask. The latter is called a reverse mask.

#####`ip_pattern`

IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern.  Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter.

For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0 and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254.  You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).

If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if virtual servers vs1 and vs2 have the same IP pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1. If a destination IP address matches two or more virtual servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server whose port number matches the port number in the request.

#####`layer2_parameters`

Use Layer 2 parameters (channel number, MAC address, and VLAN ID) in addition to the 4-tuple `<source IP>:<source port>::<destination IP>:<destination port>` that is used to identify a connection. Allows multiple TCP and non-TCP connections with the same 4-tuple to co-exist on the NetScaler appliance.

Valid options: 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false', 'enabled', 'disabled', 'ENABLED', 'DISABLED', 'YES', 'NO', 'on', 'off', 'ON', 'OFF'.

#####`lb_method`

Load balancing method. The available settings function as follows:

* 'ROUNDROBIN' - Distribute requests in rotation, regardless of the load. Weights can be assigned to services to enforce weighted round robin distribution.
* 'LEASTCONNECTION' (default) - Select the service with the fewest connections.
* 'LEASTRESPONSETIME' - Select the service with the lowest average response time.
* 'LEASTBANDWIDTH' - Select the service currently handling the least traffic.
* 'LEASTPACKETS' - Select the service currently serving the lowest number of packets per second.
* 'CUSTOMLOAD' - Base service selection on the SNMP metrics obtained by custom load monitors.
* 'LRTM' - Select the service with the lowest response time. Response times are learned through monitoring probes. This method also takes the number of active connections into account.
  
Also available are a number of hashing methods, in which the appliance extracts a predetermined portion of the request, creates a hash of the portion, and then checks whether any previous requests had the same hash value. If it finds a match, it forwards the request to the service that served those previous requests. The available hashing methods are as follows:

* 'URLHASH' - Create a hash of the request URL (or part of the URL).
* 'DOMAINHASH' - Create a hash of the domain name in the request (or part of the domain name). The domain name is taken from either the URL or the Host header. If the domain name appears in both locations, the URL is preferred. If the request does not contain a domain name, the load balancing method defaults to LEASTCONNECTION.
* 'DESTINATIONIPHASH' - Create a hash of the destination IP address in the IP header.
* 'SOURCEIPHASH' - Create a hash of the source IP address in the IP header.
* 'TOKEN' - Extract a token from the request, create a hash of the token, and then select the service to which any previous requests with the same token hash value were sent.
* 'SRCIPDESTIPHASH' - Create a hash of the string obtained by concatenating the source IP address and destination IP address in the IP header.
* 'SRCIPSRCPORTHASH' - Create a hash of the source IP address and source port in the IP header.
* 'CALLIDHASH' - Create a hash of the SIP Call-ID header.

#####`rhi_state`

Route Health Injection (RHI) functionality of the NetSaler appliance for advertising the route of the VIP address associated with the virtual server. When Vserver RHI Level (RHI) parameter is set to VSVR_CNTRLD, the following are different RHI behaviors for the VIP address on the basis of RHIstate (RHI STATE) settings on the virtual servers associated with the VIP address:

* If you set RHI STATE to PASSIVE on all virtual servers, the NetScaler ADC always advertises the route for the VIP address.
* If you set RHI STATE to ACTIVE on all virtual servers, the NetScaler ADC advertises the route for the VIP address if at least one of the associated virtual servers is in UP state.
* If you set RHI STATE to ACTIVE on some and PASSIVE on others, the NetScaler ADC advertises the route for the VIP address if at least one of the associated virtual servers, whose RHI STATE set to ACTIVE, is in UP state.

* CONNECTION - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections exceeds the threshold.
* DYNAMICCONNECTION - Spillover occurs when the number of client connections at the virtual server exceeds the sum of the maximum client (Max Clients) settings for bound services. Do not specify a spillover threshold for this setting, because the threshold is implied by the Max Clients settings of bound services.
* BANDWIDTH - Spillover occurs when the bandwidth consumed by the virtual server's incoming and outgoing traffic exceeds the threshold.
* HEALTH - Spillover occurs when the percentage of weights of the services that are UP drops below the threshold. For example, if services svc1, svc2, and svc3 are bound to a virtual server, with weights 1, 2, and 3, and the spillover threshold is 50%, spillover occurs if svc1 and svc3 or svc2 and svc3 transition to DOWN.
* NONE - Spillover does not occur.

If the virtual server has an IPv6 address, the address in the header is enclosed in brackets ([ and ]) to separate it from the port number. If you have mapped an IPv4 address to a virtual server's IPv6 address, the value of this parameter determines which IP address is inserted in the header, as follows:

* VIPADDR - Insert the IP address of the virtual server in the HTTP header regardless of whether the virtual server has an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. A mapped IPv4 address, if configured, is ignored.
* V6TOV4MAPPING - Insert the IPv4 address that is mapped to the virtual server's IPv6 address. If a mapped IPv4 address is not configured, insert the IPv6 address.
* OFF - Disable header insertion.

* `insert_http_header`: Inserts a HTTP header.
 
  `<target_expression>` = header name
  
  `<content_expression>` = header value specified as a compound text expression

* `insert_sip_header`: Inserts a SIP header.

  `<target_expression>` = header name
  
  `<content_expression>` = header value specified as a compound text expression
    
* `delete_http_header`: Deletes all occurrence of HTTP header.
  
  `<target_expression>` = header name
  
* `delete_sip_header`: Deletes all occurrence of SIP header.
      
  `<target_expression>` = header name

* `corrupt_http_header`: Corrupts all occurrence of HTTP header.

  `<target_expression>` = header name

  `<target_expression>` = Advanced text expression
  
  `<content_expression>` = Compound text expression
  
* `insert_before`: Inserts the value specified by attr before the target text reference.

 `<target_expression>` = Advanced text expression
 
 `<content_expression>` = Compound text expression

  For example, you can replace all occurrences of 'abcd':
  
  ~~~
  replace_all => true,
  pattern     => 'efgh.*'
  ~~~
  
  or 
  
  ~~~
  replace_all => true,
  search      => 'aoeu'
  ~~~
